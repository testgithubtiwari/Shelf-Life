Some Information About the Camera Module used OV7670:

OV7670 Camera Module is a FIFO camera Module available from different Manufacturers with different pin Configurations. TheOV7670 provides full frame, windowed 8-bit images in a wide range of formats. The image array is capable of operating at up to 30 frames per second (fps) in VGA. The OV7670 includes

Image Sensor Array(of about 656 x 488 pixels)
Timing Generator
Analog Signal Processor
A/D Converters
Test Pattern Generator
Digital Signal Processor(DSP)
Image Scaler
Digital Video Port
LED and Strobe Flash Control Output
The OV7670 image sensor is controlled using Serial Camera Control Bus (SCCB) which is an I2C interface (SIOC, SIOD) with a maximum clock frequency of 400KHz.

The Camera comes with handshaking signals such as:

VSYNC: Vertical Sync Output – Low during frame
HREF:  Horizontal Reference – High during active pixels of row
PCLK: Pixel Clock Output – Free running clock. Data is valid on rising edge
In addition to this, it has several more signals such as

D0-D7: 8-bit YUV/RGB Video Component Digital Output
PWDN: Power Down Mode Selection – Normal Mode  and Power Down Mode
XCLK: System Clock Input
Reset: Reset Signal
The OV7670 is clocked from a 24MHz oscillator. This gives a Pixel Clock(PCLK) output of 24MHz. The FIFO provides 3Mbps of video frame buffer memory. The test pattern generator features 8-bar color bar pattern, fade-to-gray color bar patter. Now let’s start programming the Arduino UNO for testing Camera OV7670 and grabbing frames using serial port reader.
